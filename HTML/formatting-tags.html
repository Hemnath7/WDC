    <p>In the <b>4.5 billion</b> years of <strong>Earthâ€™s</strong> existence</p>
    <p>
      humans have been here for <i>200,000 years</i>, far under one percent of
      the <em>history</em> of the planet.
    </p>
    Further shaving down that <small>fraction</small> of a percent, modern
    civilization only formed 6,000 <sub>years</sub> ago,
    <p>
      and the Industrial Revolution began under 300 <sup>years</sup> ago. The
      internet, in its initial form as <mark>ARPANET</mark> , is
      <ins>53 years</ins> old, and the World Wide Web is <del>32</del>
      <ins>33</ins> . By every standard possible, we are only in the nascent
      stages of history.
